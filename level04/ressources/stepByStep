/home/user/level04/level04.pl

this file contains some perl code that appears to send data to a web page,
expecting an answer

using curl to get informations from this address,
we are getting some interesting informations

when doing the following command, "curl localhost:4747",
we get an index page that matches the one we are getting from the program.

The program seems to send a value x to the webpage, expecting an answer.
From this, we can mimique the program and manually send a x value

it would look something like this : curl localhost:4747/?x=<insert value>

from this command, we are getting the value back from the page,
meaning that we could possibly inject some bash code to get the flag

after many tries,
we found that the following command allows us to execute getflag : 

curl 'localhost:4747/?x=$(getflag)'

flag : ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
