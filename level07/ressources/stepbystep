When you log in to this user, there is a binary in the home dir.
Using ghidra to read its C equivalent, you can easily understand what it does;
it takes the env var "LOGNAME" and displays it.

You just have to mess arround with export and syntax to give the binary a string
he will execute:

export 'LOGNAME=$(getflag)'

then you log into getflag.
