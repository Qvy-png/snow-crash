First, when you log on the "Level05" user,
you get a message notifying you that you received a new "mail"

You can read in /var/mail/level05
It contains a cronjob instruction line :
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

You can add this command line in the crontab file : crontab -e

This command line will execute a bash script located at :
/usr/sbin/openarenaserver.

The bash script is executed once every 2 minutes by cronjob,
when executed, it checks.

If there is an executable bash script located at : /opt/openarenaserver/*,
it executes it, then deletes it.

You just have to write a small bash script executing the "getflag" command,
and redirecting its output into a file you can read later (won't be deleted).
You can create files in /var/crash so we'll put it here.

getflag > /var/crash/res

now just cat your /var/crash/res file and the token is yours
