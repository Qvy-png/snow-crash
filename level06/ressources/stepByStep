level06 seems to be a binary file that uses the level06.php file as a template.

Since we have access to the levell06.php's code, we can check what it does.
In our case, it is a simple php script that plays with regex parsing,
with arguments that are passed in parameters.

After a few researches on the different regex interpretations,
we found out that it uses /e, which is a depricated argument, easily attackable.
Its purpose is to execute php code within itself. 

We can conclude that it is possible to execute some php commands,
that would allow us to execute code on our machine,
with the rights of the level06 binary file.

Further researches shows that we can use the command "exec",
which is a php command able to execute code on the host machine.

We came up with the following php code : [x {${exec(getflag)}}]

for a simple explanation,
the ${} format allows us to create a sub-shell that will execute code,
on the behalf of the binary file.
So we ran the exec command, as stated previously, on the getflag command.
Since level06 has the flag07 rights, it directly gave us the result of the flag.
