there's a file at the home directory of level03

`-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03  level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03`

this file has the flag03 permissions

After using ghidra, a software that allows decompilation of binary files,
we found out that it uses the following line of code : 

"system( /usr/bin/usr echo Exploit me)"

from this basis, it means that it uses whatever echo is available on the path.

After further tests,
making our own echo with a "hello world" on the path /var/crash,
we found out that the theory works.

we modified the path, adding the /var/crash:
	argument to the beginning of the variable in the env,
	we succeeded to get the flag.

The custom echo used the following command : system( getflag );

Since the level03 binary has the flag03 rights,
it meant that we did not need to log-in to any user named flag03,
and directly got the flag as a respons.

the flag is the following :
