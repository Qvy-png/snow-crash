nothing in the home directory, something is probably hidden somewhere.

with the command find, we can find files and directories related to users.
In our case, flag00.

We came up with the following command : `find / -user flag00`

-> result showing a ton of forbidden paths,
but also two paths leading to the same file, containing a string

Tested raw string for the flag00 password : X

We searched for a way to decrypt the string,
we tried the most common "encryption", cesar, with all possible offsets.
The most meaningful one was found on the offset of 15.

password : nottoohardhere
