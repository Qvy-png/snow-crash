When you log in, you get a binary and a token, the binary is supposed to 
display the token but it won't if its name is token.

To bypass this rule, you can create a symlink (in /var/crash) and call it
whatever name you want:

once in /var/crash: ln -s /home/user/level08/token test

Then execute the binary with your newly created symlink:

./level08 /var/crash/test.

Then log in to flag08.
