When you log in, in your home repo you have 2 files, one is a binary and one is
a token wich contains non printable characters when you try to display it.

The token has been "Transformed" by the binary, if you test it you'll see that
when you give him an argument it will go through every character and add
n+index to its ascii value.

Once you know that, you just have to write a C binary that will do the same
thing but reversed.

smth like that:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int     main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int i = 0;
        int len = strlen(argv[1]);

        while (argv[1][i] != '\0')
        {
                printf("%c", argv[1][i] - i);
                i++;
        }
        return 0;
}

Just send this c file inside the SC machine with scp (put it in var crash since
you can write here):

"scp -P 4243 decode.c level09@localhost:/var/crash/"

Now you just have to put the "cat token" output into a env variable so you can
use this variable with our code.

It gives you the flag09 password.
