there is the file level02.pcap in the home directory.

Using SCP, we managed to exfiltrate the file from the virtual machine,
and imported it with wireshark on another virtual machine.

From this point, there's a function that allows us to follow the TCP prints,
and it leaded us to a step by step process of the recorded event.

This event showed someone trying to log-in to a page, with a password.

This password was the following : ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

After some research, using the ascii table and the hexadecimal values,
we found out that the dots in the middle of the password were key presses,
and it leaded us to find "DEL" as the corresponding characters.

After following the DEL characters and taking out the unnecessary letters,
we got the following password : ft_waNDReL0L
